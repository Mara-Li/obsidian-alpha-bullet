# Sort Markdown List

A simple and efficient Obsidian plugin to quickly sort your markdown lists. It sorts alphabetically based on the first word of each line, with advanced options available.

## ‚ú® Features

- Sort unordered lists alphabetically (A-Z or Z-A)
- Advanced sorting with grouping by initial letter
- Multi-language support (English, French)
- Seamless integration with the Obsidian interface

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1. Open the file that contains the list you want to sort.
2. Open the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) and search for "Sort Markdown List".
3. Choose your preferred sorting option (ascending, descending, or advanced).
4. The list will be sorted instantly.

## üîß Examples
### Basic Sorting
- **Ascending**: Sorts the list items in alphabetical order (A-Z).
- **Descending**: Sorts the list items in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A).

### Advanced Sorting
Advanced sorting groups list items under a heading for their initial letter. For example, if you have a list like this:
```md
Introduction

- Banana: yellow
- Apple: green

Some text.

- Zebra: black and white
- Cat: furry
```
It will be sorted like this:
```md
Introduction

## A
- Apple: green
## B
- Banana: yellow

Some text.

## C
- Cat: furry
## Z
- Zebra: black and white
```

### Frontmatter Support
You can setup option in the frontmatter, allowing interaction with other plugins (i.e. Linter, Macros‚Ä¶) with using the `Sort based on frontmatter` command.

> [!TIP]
> The settings of the plugin allow to set the default values when no frontmatter keys are found.

The keys that are supported are:
- `sml_sort`: Sort the list based on the frontmatter key. The value can be `true` or `false`. Setting to `false` will disable the sorting. 
- `sml_descending` : Sort the list in descending order. The value can be `true` or `false`. 
- `sml_advanced`: Group each first word by their initial letter. The value can be `true` or `false`. 
- `sml_level` : The level of the heading to use for grouping. The value must be between 1 and 6, and must be a number.
