# Alpha Bullet

A simple and efficient Obsidian plugin to quickly sort your markdown lists. It sorts alphabetically based on the first word of each line, with advanced options available.

## ‚ú® Features

- Sort unordered lists alphabetically (A-Z or Z-A)
- Advanced sorting with grouping by initial letter
- Multi-language support (English, French)
- Seamless integration with the Obsidian interface

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1. Open the file that contains the list you want to sort.
2. Open the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) and search for "Alpha Bullet".
3. Choose your preferred sorting option (ascending, descending, or advanced).
4. The list will be sorted instantly.

## üîß Examples
### Basic Sorting
- **Ascending**: Sorts the list items in alphabetical order (A-Z).
- **Descending**: Sorts the list items in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A).

### Advanced Sorting
Advanced sorting groups list items under a heading for their initial letter. For example, if you have a list like this:
```md
Introduction

- Banana: yellow
- Apple: green

Some text.

- Zebra: black and white
- Cat: furry
```
It will be sorted like this:
```md
Introduction

## A
- Apple: green
## B
- Banana: yellow

Some text.

## C
- Cat: furry
## Z
- Zebra: black and white
```

### Frontmatter Support
You can configure sorting options directly in your note's frontmatter, allowing seamless interaction with other plugins (such as Linter, Macros, etc.) by using the `Sort based on frontmatter` command.

**Example frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
sml_sort: true
sml_descending: false
sml_advanced: true
sml_level: 2
---
```

> [!TIP]
> The plugin's settings let you define default values if no frontmatter keys are found.

**Supported frontmatter keys:**
- `sml_sort`: Enable or disable sorting for the list. (`true` or `false`)
- `sml_descending`: Sort the list in descending order. (`true` or `false`)
- `sml_advanced`: Group items by their initial letter. (`true` or `false`)
- `sml_level`: Heading level for grouping (number between 1 and 6).
